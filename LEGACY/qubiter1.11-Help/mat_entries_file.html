<P>
(Matrix Entries File is called "MATNAME.in")
<P>
Qubiter uses files that list the entries of a unitary matrix U. This is an
example of such files:

<P>
Qubiter ignores the 2 lines preceded by //. The second line tells how many
bits are necessary to label U's columns (or rows, since U must be square).
In the example above, two bits are necessary to label U's column, so one
expects U to be a 4 X 4 matrix with 16 entries. Each line after the third
represents a complex number Z. The real part of Z&nbsp;is listed first, then
some white space to the right of it, and then the imaginary part of Z to
the right of that. The entries in the first column of U should be listed
first, then those in the second column of U, etc.
