    <FONT COLOR="Blue">MATNAME-chk.out</FONT> This file is an output of a
    compilation run. It is also an output of a decompilation run. The file is
    of the form discussed in the section entitled "Matrix Entries File". In both
    a compilation and a decompilation run, it contains the entries of the matrix
    obtained by multiplying out the SEO contained in file MATNAME-engl.in .
  <LI>
    <FONT COLOR="Blue">MATNAME-err.out</FONT> This file is an output of a
    compilation run. The file is of the form discussed in the section entitled
    "Matrix Entries File". It lists the entries of the matrix which equals the
    difference between the matrix in file MATNAME.in and the matrix in file
    MATNAME-chk.out.
  <LI>
    <FONT COLOR="Blue">MATNAME-pict.out</FONT> This file is an output of a
    compilation run. The file is an ASCII picture of the data contained in
    MATNAME-engl.out. In MATNAME-pict.out, each elementary gate is represented
    by a horizontal line of symbols. Consider a single such line.
    <UL>
      <LI>
	There is a 1 to 1 correspondence between the characters in the line and the
	qubits of an array of qubits. The rightmost character represents bit 0. The
	next to rightmost character in the line represents bit 1. And so on.
      <LI>
	A bit that is not operated on is represented by a " | " character (except
	when it is represented by a "-" character. See below.)
      <LI>
	A bit that is rotated about the Z axis (ditto, Y axis) is represented by
	a "Z" character (ditto, "Y" character).
      <LI>
	Suppose the gate is a controlled gate (i.e., a cnot or a controlled phase
	shift) with one or more controls. Then a&nbsp;control bit is represented
	by a "@" character (ditto, "0" character) if it must be true (ditto, false)
	for the action of the gate (i.e, bit fip, phase sift) to occur. In the case
	of a c-not, the bit to be flipped is represented by an "X" character. Bits
	that are not being operated on but which have the misfortune of lying between
	a control and a flipper bit or between two control bits are represented by
	a "-".
      <LI>
	If the gate is a pure phase acting on all bits, all bits are represented
	by the "~" character.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    <FONT COLOR="Blue">MATNAME-log.out</FONT> This file is an output of a
    compilation run. It lists the two left side matrices, the CS angles of the
    D matrix, and the two right side matrices, for every CSD performed during
    the run.
  <LI>
    <FONT COLOR="Blue">MATNAME-pmut.out</FONT> This file is an output of a
    compilation run whenever pmut_opt=1. If the matrix U<SUB>initial </SUB>being
    decomposed has N<SUB>B </SUB>bits, the file lists all the N<SUB>B</SUB>!
    permutations of N<SUB>B </SUB>bits. For each permutation, it gives the length
    of the SEO obtained for that permutation of U<SUB>initial </SUB>.&nbsp;
